Sonsors:
pin 1, 2, 3, 8 = Sensors in
pin 10 = TSCAP pin

LED-strip:
pin 4 = datapin
5v, grnd = power in and out

requirements:
- Arduino (of vergelijkbaar)
- USB cable
- Tinfoil
- LED-strip
- 4x resistor (1 megohm)
- capacitor (tussen 10nF en 100nF, dus any capacitor eindigend op 3, behalve degene met R) (Hoe kleiner het getal, hoe stabieler de reading)
- Jumper cables


This code is used in the project Imagionary 2024 (The Reflection) at the Netherlands Film Academy. In a week time we (the immersive media students) had to make an immersive music expirience together with a Conservatory student.
We split it up in two parts:
In the first part the audience could interact with a plant by touching the leaves. By touching the leaves a music sample starts playing and the light on the LED-strip start flickering in a color.
The second part is a live performance with visuals reacting to the music.
